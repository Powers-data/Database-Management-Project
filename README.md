# Database-Management-Project

## About the project
This project was about designing and implementing a database to solve a data management problem of my own choice of data. The intent of this project is to have an opportunity to work on something of interest to me that should have some real utility as a completed database. This project is broken up into 2 parts. The first part is the design specifications detailing the data to be tracked and how all the elements work together. Also need to specify any business rules that dictate how the data are to be managed. As in any good development project, also need to identify stakeholders and detail what data they will need to access and maintain. Document at least five data questions the data must answer to be relevant. The second part is the implementation of the design created in part 1. This will include the SQL statements to create the tables and columns to hold the data and any constraints that implement the business rules. Also included are representative statements for the basic Data Manipulation Language (DML) that implement the create, read, update, and delete statements (referred to as CRUD) used in maintaining the data.
